# FAQ

## How do I pronounce MSG-RS?

You can either pronounce it as "message", or as "em-es-gee". We prefer the latter.

## Is MSG-RS production ready?

MSG-RS is currently in ALPHA, and is not yet recommended for use in production.

We plan to release MSG-RS to [Crates.io](https://crates.io/) once it reaches a beta stage.
Until then, we recommend using the git dependency as shown in the [Getting started](./getting-started.md) section.
