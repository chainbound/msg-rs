## Overview

`msg-rs` is a messaging library that was inspired by projects like [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/) and [Nanomsg](https://nanomsg.org/).
It was built because we needed a Rust-native messaging library like those above.

## Documentation

The ðŸ“– [MSG-RS Book][book] contains detailed information on how to use the library.
